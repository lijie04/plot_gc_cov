### Description
**[gccov](https://github.com/jlli6t/gccov)** is a tiny tool used for visualization of GC and coverage of assemblies.

### Install
pip3 install gccov

### Example
We are interested in the distribution of GC & coverage of two genomes among the whole assemblies.
Blue and red bubbles are representing genome A and B, respectively. It is very clear in the below figure that these two genomes share similar GC content and coverage.

When you zoom in, you can clearly see the difference between these two genomes.
